## Introduction

ft_transcendence is a surprise project designed to push our boundaries in computer science. Reflecting on the beginning of our coding journeys, we now face a monumental challenge that merges our passions for web development, gaming, and cybersecurity. The project invites us to explore unfamiliar technologies, make crucial design decisions, and deliver a sophisticated, secure, and interactive Pong contest website.

---

## Objectives

- **Adapt & Innovate:** Embrace unknown technologies and leverage our adaptability and problem-solving skills.
- **Real-Time Multiplayer:** Implement a website that supports live Pong battles—with both local and remote interactions.
- **Comprehensive Module Integration:** Extend the core functionality with advanced modules encompassing web frameworks, user management, gameplay enhancements, AI, cybersecurity, devops, 3D graphics, accessibility, and server-side innovations.
- **Security & Reliability:** Address all security concerns (password hashing, SQL injections, XSS, HTTPS, etc.) and ensure a seamless user experience.
- **Modular Growth:** Allow for incremental improvements via additional modules, letting us score bonus points for each innovative feature added.

---

## Mandatory Part

At the core of ft_transcendence lies the mandatory part: creating a dynamic website for the Pong contest. The website must:

- **Offer an Engaging User Interface:** Enable players to register with an alias and jump straight into live Pong games.
- **Facilitate Real-Time Multiplayer:** Support matches where two players (sharing the same keyboard or playing remotely) contest in Pong.
- **Guarantee Fair Play:** Ensure the same paddle speed for all participants and provide an intuitive, error-free gaming experience.
- **Prioritize Security:** Employ state-of-the-art security practices to protect user data, prevent attacks, and enforce best practices in web development.

---

## Modules

Beyond the mandatory requirements, ft_transcendence is modular. We can choose from a diverse set of modules to enhance and extend our platform. Here is an overview of the key module themes:

- **Web & Frameworks:** 
  - Implement a robust backend using frameworks like Fastify with Node.js.
  - Develop the frontend with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript.
  - Integrate a lightweight database solution (SQLite) for consistency.
  - Store tournament scores securely on the blockchain using Avalanche and Solidity smart contracts.

- **User Management & Authentication:**
  - Build standard user management and authentication systems.
  - Enable remote authentication via systems like Google Sign-In.
  - Incorporate secure session management using 2FA and JWT.

- **Gameplay & User Experience:**
  - Support remote and multiplayer gameplay.
  - Introduce new games with user history and matchmaking.
  - Enhance the platform with a live chat feature for real-time user communication.

- **AI & Dashboards:**
  - Integrate an AI opponent that challenges players without using A*.
  - Create comprehensive dashboards for tracking user and game statistics.

- **Cybersecurity:**
  - Deploy WAF/ModSecurity and use HashiCorp Vault for secrets management.
  - Ensure GDPR compliance with data anonymization and secure account deletion.

- **Devops & Infrastructure:**
  - Build a microservices architecture.
  - Set up log management and monitoring with the ELK stack and Prometheus/Grafana.

- **Graphics & Accessibility:**
  - Leverage advanced 3D techniques using Babylon.js to transform the visual experience of Pong.
  - Ensure cross-device compatibility, multi-language support, and accessible features for visually impaired users.
  - Integrate Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for performance boosts and improved SEO.

- **Server-Side Pong:**
  - Replace the basic Pong implementation with a robust, server-side solution.
  - Create API endpoints to allow CLI-based gameplay in parallel with the web interface.

Each module is an opportunity to earn bonus points while showcasing our technical prowess, creativity, and teamwork. The decision on which modules to implement is critical, as some may depend on—or even conflict with—others. Smart planning and project management will be key to our success.

## Bonus Part

The bonus part is designed to reward innovative additions that exceed the core requirements. Points will be awarded based on the complexity and impact of each additional module:

- **Minor Modules:** 5 points each.
- **Major Modules:** 10 points each.

**Note:** The bonus will only be evaluated if the mandatory part is executed perfectly. Our goal is to build a flawless and impressive platform before venturing into bonus territory.

---

## Submission & Peer Evaluation

- **Repository Submission:** All project work must be submitted in our Git repository.
- **File Naming & Organization:** Ensure that file names strictly adhere to the provided guidelines.
- **Peer Review:** Our peer-evaluation process will focus solely on the content within the repository. Clear documentation and a well-maintained codebase will greatly influence the final evaluation.
